# ML-Kmeans_Clustering
This repository contains codes for K-means Clustering Algorithm in machine learning

### K-means Clustering Algorithm in Machine learning  
* K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning or data science.  
* It aims to partition data into k clusters in a way that data points in the same cluster are similar and data points in the different clusters are farther apart.  
* Machine learning comes in handy for this task. Particularly, clustering, the most important unsupervised learning problem, is able to create categories grouping similar individuals.  
* These categories are called clusters. A cluster is a collection of points in a dataset. These points are more similar between them than they are to points belonging to other clusters. Distance-based clustering groups the points into some number of clusters such that distances within the cluster should be small while distances between clusters should be large.  


## Data Set Information

The csv file corresponding used herein was downloaded from [Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/akram24/mall-customers).
The dataset contains data about customers from a Mall. The information gather is: `Customer ID`, `Age`, `Annual Income (k$)`, `Spending Score (1-100)`.
_Every person is different and so is their behavior as customers_. 

## Analysis

This repository contains two files:

- `K-means Clustering.ipybn`: In this jupyter notebook, exploratory data analysis is performed. Moreover, the algorithm assumptions are checked. It is also shown how to predict to which segment a new customers belongs to. 
- `customers.csv` dataset used to perform the analysis.

The whole analysis was done using JupyterLab and Python, using libraries such as: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
